# Week 1 - App Containerization
## Containerize Backend
### Run Python
I have to run python first before adding docker container then move to adding the dockerfile
### Add Dockerfile
Created a file in backend-flask/
- after creating the file I added the code and extra notes as I follow along with the live stream recorded video. In the past week I wanted to find out more about docker and how react works.
Finally got the pip3 install running
My ports aren't showing especially port=4567 so responses I keep getting is "IndentationError: unexpected indent" (still need to practice how to create ports)
When running docker container run --rm -p 4567:4567 -d backend-flask, I get an error message: "unable to find image"
Decided to work on VSCode but still ran in the same error

## Containerize Frontend
Will work on containerizing Frontend once I get the Backend working
