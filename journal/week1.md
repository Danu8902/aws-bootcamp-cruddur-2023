# Week 1 - App Containerization
## Containerize Backend
### Run Python
I have to run python first before adding docker container then move to adding the dockerfile
### Add Dockerfile
Created a file in backend-flask/
- after creating the file I added the code and extra notes as I follow along with the live stream recorded video. In the past week I wanted to find out more about docker and how react works.
